#include<iostream>

// hashtag-include is a preprocessor directive to include system files or libraries so that we can type and give output from what we want.
// cout will gonna work if we include iostream in this inclusion. iostream is the basic file for taking input and printing output
using namespace std;  // using namespace std, we can atleast eliminate all std applies from every line. namespace std is from standard library of cpp.

int main () //extremely imp, every executable is done by main ftn, while int is the return value of this ftn
{
    cout<<"Hello World\n"; //cout is to print the output! slashn is used to breaklines, semicolon to end the statement

    return 0;
