Section 7/ Chapter 3 Challenge

Write a C++ program as follows:
Declare 2 empty and integer declared vectors named as:
vector1 and vector2.

Add 10 and 20 in vector1 dynamically using pushback method
Display the elements of vector1 using at method and find its size.

Add 100 and 200 in vector1 dynamically using pushback method
Display the elements of vector1 using at method and find its size.

Create an empty 2D vector named as vector_2d
Hint: vector_2d is a vector of vectors.

Add vector1 into vector_2d dynamically using pushback method.
Add vector2 into vector_2d dynamically using pushback method.

Display the elements of vector_2d using at method.

Change vector1.at(0) into 1000.

Display the elements of vector_2d again using at method.
Display the elements in vector1
